# Mission
to improve the webcomic industry by providing a resource to learn and an open source CMS to publish along with a place to create and network with other artists plus share their webcomic
Why we made it- to encourage people to realize the benefits of helping each other through sharing
Description
Who – Primarily new and veteran webcomic creators, but also aspiring and professional comic book artist, and comic book enthusiast

Why they use it – to gain the exposure/experience needed to break into the comics and related industries; working for publishers or self-publishing and if they are a reader find new comics

What
A community-driven non-profit network with a focus on developing products, resources, and services that enables creatives of all levels to network and share their knowledge and skills to publish, promote plus collaborate to help each other create higher quality IP of their own.

How (one paragraph) – benefit webcomic creators and reader by creating an online directory of a comic character created by a user that is affiliated with more than one story through creative commons. This will encourage readers to follow the character of their favorite comic to be introduced to new ones. It benefits artist/writers by enabling them to contribute to one-shot comics of current and potentially new comics
Overview
(Sandwich it, talk about the customer the tell me
My story then back to the customer then sell/present the product)
CNS is short for creative network square and will be similar to a town square but for artist and it's on the internet 
Like many other kids in 90s I watched many of Movies, Saturday morning cartoons, and anime adapted from comics and manga. Once I discovered and started reading the comics and manga from these shows I became inspired me and wanted to create a comic of my own. 
I started working on my own comic at the ripe old age of 8, by 11 Started drawing it the actual comic.
[Image of old comic]
This around the time of the .com bubble, so I didn’t want to make just any comic. It was to be what I thought at the time revolutionary ― I was going to put it on the web! As you can probably tell I was oblivious of the existence of webcomics at the time.
Unfortunately by time I got in highschool I found new interests and stopped drawing and writing so I never finished. But by the end of college I got back into comics, manga. With this came a renewed Interest in art and started working on my original comic idea again.
Of course after so much time away I came back a little rusty but wiser and the webcomic Industry had changed as well. This sparked new Ideas and of course just like before I couldn’t just create a webcomic I want to be revolutionary, but unlike last time It will be from new perspective and a plan will take it one step at a time. 
i plan for cns to become a community and a place for creatives to help each and learn and grow together for right now the focus will be on webcomics as I create my own webcomic I will be build free and open source products (this includes the webcomic as well) to make it better and share them on cns plus along with tips and trips I learn along the way. Since I am just getting started with my webcomic I will be building everything for it from scratch the first thing I will be releasing is a CMS designed just for webcomics. I will keep you updated and the latest current and upcoming projects and features. And you can also send your contribution features wish list and if you can contribute on open source projects on github
Why open it is to increase competition and make sure someone succeeded improve upon what i fail and to prevent a wonder bread incident
Going forward most of the projects will be aimed at improving our flagship product webcomic + cms although you will not be required to need the cms in order to benefit from cns products and services. Using the first party equal third party philosophy Whatever I build for myself my webcomic may also be useful for others and it will be made available for others free and open sourced. This also goes for what I learn and even my skills someone other might have a need for it so I will share and trade those as well

# Point System
You start off with maybe 10000. Which is over! 9000! points! You can use the points to advertise for help for your comic book. Evertime someone contributes to the comic they will get poits of your choice. HTe more points you give the greater talent you will attract. The more you contribute to other projects the more points you earn. When you need more points you can also use cash to buy more points if you don't have time to contribute--which I assume will be the way most people use point system. Buying points will be the main way that CNS plus earns money. The second will be Ads on the comic. Points can also maybe be used to advertise a comic. Maybe the more popular CNS becomes the more points will cost to buy. This will mean early adopters will have the advantatage

# Character/Idea Vault
People can also earn points by offering their character or idea as tribute. they will get points rather it is creative commons or not it might encourage more peolple to liecnce work as creative commns because they will be the ones that people will gravitate toward. The characters can start as an character profile and people can ask for help drawing it or they can draw thier self. It will be great for artist that  need practice as a character designer. People can also add ideas to the vault this way people can get paid for ideas may 2 points. The vault is spefic to CNS plus and is the only centralized part of the website. People can buy these idea and characters to use in thier comic using points

people can add simple quotes monologuesand lines they come up with that can be used in stories and even get paid. maybe there can be tags such monologue, dialogue, villain hero, mentor etc

# Fan fiction
CC work can also encourage people to make fan fictions which will also encourage CC work. This become free promotion from fans including fan art. It will also allow fans to get paid for being fans and also create the posibilty of a a fan chaarcter being used in the comic of their favorite creator


## My 2 cents
You can give 2 points to upvote on the comic character, inked page, penciled page, color page etc. This will give the contributor points. The owner of the comic can then choose which contribution they wnat to add to the comic. This makes it like patron and if you give more than 2 cents you get an NFT of the contribution. Maybe if you match the top contributor this way it is like biding on art expect you can not lose the bid if someone bids higher than you.

## My 3 Sentences
People will get paid for contributing feedback on work but they will not get paid for upvotes at least in the begining depending on how things go I may allow them to get paid as will but a less percentage than the people that contributed art work. Maybe even get aid based on upvotes

# Recurisive points
To make sure people get paid a fair share people get paid recursvly. This means if I contribute a pencil someone else can take that pencil and press the button to make a deviation/change to the original. THe OG creater will get attribution allong with the the person that made the OG art. I will have to work out the distribution of points based on votes from contributors of the CNS open source project.

# StumbleUpon like Ads
your comic is advertise randomly in which you can keep clicking the random button until you find a comic you want to conrtribute to. The person advertising is gurentueed to get contributions and  the person contributing is gurrented to get paid so thier will be no spec work. 

# MVP
Using github and reddit for contributions and voting and maybe using reddits coins system along with git hubs payment system

# Everchanging sytem
THier will be a chief tournament in whic the winner will be crown co chief of CNS plus they will get to have input on ideas of the system. THis is one posiblity another is that AI will compete to be crown co cheif to help come up with ideas. it may be chatgpt gemni cronk etc. The Ais winner will be based votes at first then a CNS+chacter card gaemthen evolve to a cyber.beast game to crown the co chief

# Entertainment indutsry
## Photography
posting refrence images and what not

## Music
People will be able to contribute music like CC Mixer some will provide the beat others will others the lryics antoher the voice. The songs can be modifeed by any one making america great again one beat at time
## Anime
Comic will eventually evolve into animation which will be paired with music for opening songs and songs within the story. The comic will basicly serve as story boards and key frames. My comic will serve as the base as I will draw it as one panel pages instead of 3-5 panels. Hopefully others will follow suite
## Games
The CNS card game will serve as the begining to taping into the game  indusrty and will evole into the cyber.beast//cyber.beat game. it will be based on the cyber.beast comic. People can subit character stories and etc. This will be CNS plus reachs it Max.
## Live Action
Geting scripts and editing them. Also for special effects. Voice Overs. Logos


# Version 1 Character Vault Character Network Squaure
Character can be submited to the vault it will include a character profile. This profile has the Bio and images which includes concept, fan art, and a charaacter design sheet. The best image is shown on the right hand of the page. The rest of the images are shoem at random with the best images having the higher probability of being shown. Maybe you can pay to have it increase th chance of it being shown much lie an add when the random image button is shown. This will give then exposure so that they can get hired.

# Version 2 Idea Vaualt Creative Network Square
Ideas can be simple or complex it can be character vehicle creatures and envoirment art.

# Manifesto
My dream is that it will be used for more than just the entertaimen industry which why it is open source and hopfully advance the gig ecoonmy
It will be first come first serve everyone that contributes will get paid. Iit will aslo be intreated with the cyber.beast video game and a UBI this 50-80% of the profit from CNS plus will be used for an UBI. people can mine bitgems by slaying cyber.beast. As long as you are using a hub yuo will get a UBI you most contribute in some way at leat once a day to get paid a ubi. It may be cleaning up code or provide theropy for somebody. doing theropy you will need a lince to particpate. and you will get paid based on how good you are as a theripest

## Ai
Ai will be use to considated and unifie art at first. instead having someone that specailize in making sure all of the the comic art is in maybe a style guid master. IT will be replaceed by AI that will pick the art style of a spefic artst and make sure all of the art matches that art style the artis that gets picked picked will get paid maybe pointes/tokens by the Ai. They will also get points based on the income earned from selling the the comic as nfts or ads. May the primary AI being used will be the one that one the chiefs tounrament. voted on in part by skill and bitgems and views. This is much like an election as people may choose ai that is transparnet and enviornmentally friendly

CNS plus also called creative network square. Like the name implies is a central hub designed to serve creative people 

is suite of open source products. Like a square in real life--being a public place for gatherings or doing business--the plan is for it to be decentralized

CNS plus will start with 

CNS+ Roadmap
WebcomicX › comicplus
Since I already have the webcomicx CMS this will start as the flagship product for now. It's dated but still functional so feel free to use it.

The plan is for comicplus to connect with the other tools and community. To make things easier comicplus content will be hosted on GitHub with the option to mirror it on your own. I'd like to think of it more as FTP cleient for uploading to github but it can also be hosted on the cloud. This is important for those that want more control or sites that outgrow free github hosting. But being conected to the free github hosting is great for people getting started. This is my attempt at making a decentralized

CNS+(Character Network Square)
A place to upload original characters that other people can use. To make sharing easier they should be primarly Creative Commons licensed but you can upload copright as well but I have no way to vet them at the moment

CNS+(Comic Network Square)
A plugin for ComicPlus the enables seemless comic collaboration on github hosted comics

CNS+ (Character Narrative Suniverse/Square)
World Wiki for comics
A wiki for the universe of your comic much like World Anvil but it is shared in a decentrazited network apart of a larger multiverse for the comics of the CNS. It will allow people to not just share charactrs but entire worlds(suniverse). Thier will be 2 versions one for creative commons comics and the other for copy right comics

Suniverse.cc (A Creative Commons Shared Universe)
My attempt at making a marvel like open franchise starting with my own comics

Suniverse.net
A shared universe for non creative commons comics

Collectable card Game
A game that influence the multiverse event
